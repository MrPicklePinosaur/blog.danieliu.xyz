Welcome to my blog! This is where I will post random snippets and possibly guides to some tech related stuff.
This blog was generated with a very trash <a href="https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/pb">shell script</a> I wrote, for the sake of avoiding
bloated web frameworks. There's still a couple of things I would like to improve, such as how you can't have certain special characters
in the blog name, and I would probably like some sort of tag feature to filter the blog posts. Oh and, feel free to subscribe to the 
<a href="https://blog.danieliu.xyz/rss.xml">rss feed</a>, if you care enough.

<p>Here's a random code block, just for css testing purposes:</p>
<code>sudo rm -rf /</code>

<p>And here's a random gif:</p>

<p>That's all for now :&gt; </p>
