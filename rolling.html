Great site anime site for learning japanese called <a href="https://animelon.com/">animelon</a> that provides english subtitles as well as japanese (with options for romaji and hiragana). You can also hover over subtitles to get definitions, and jump between dialogue lines. Anyways, it has some decently high quality stuff so it can used as a normal anime site. Only downside is that it doesn't have the newer stuff, since they need to get the subs and translate them.

<h3>What the heck is Suckless even?</h3>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p>
This guide will focus specifically on dwm, as it is one of the more involved installs. The installation and patching process is the same for any other Suckless software though.
</p>



<p>
Before you do any patching and the like, you need to actually install dwm.
To do this, clone the repo from the <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless site</a>.
</p>

<p>
Inside the working directory, all we need to do is to tell the makefile to install the software for us, so run 
<code>make &amp;&amp; sudo make clean install</code>

notice that we didn't give sudo to make, it's better practice to not run commands as root unless you absolutely need to.
</p>

<p>
If the make didn't succeed, chances are you are missing some headers. On my fresh install, I was missing the X11/Xft/Xft.h header and X11/extensions/Xinerama.h header, so you will need to install the libxft and libxinerama packages respectively (for arch at least).
</p>

<p>
The second issue I had at first was that I didn't have any fonts installed, I got the adobe-source-code-pro-fonts package.
</p>

<p>
... and that's it! The installation process is done, not so hard right?
If you use X, simply add the line:
<code>exec dwm</code>
to the bottom of you .xinitrc file. Keep in mind that any lines after this will be <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#xinitrc">ignored</a>. Now on your next X server start, you will be greeted with dwm, in all it's beautiful glory.
</p>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>
As per traditional Suckless style, "source code is documentation". The <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial/">suckless page</a> gives a pretty good overview of the default keybindings a features, but you should get used to reading the README (ofc), reading the man page (if there is one), and reading the config.def.h file (probably the most important). We will talk about configuration in a bit, but let's just open up the config.def.h file up real quick and take a look around.
</p>

Need to go through default keybindings 

[TEMP] if you don't have a terminal installed yet, we can quit out of dwm and view in our tty


[maybe include code snippet of Keys or screenshot]

<p>
Let's first look at the array called 'Keys'. Instead of constantly going to the Suckless page or searching up something like 'plz, how do i close window in dwm', all the keybindings and their functions are defined here, so feel free to consult this file as often as you need to.
</p>

Talk about dwm tags, different layouts, advantage over i3 and other managers than let you choose layout direction

[TAGS]
Basically like standard 'workspaces', but work a tiny bit different.
Gotta admit, almost never needed to have multiple tags active.
