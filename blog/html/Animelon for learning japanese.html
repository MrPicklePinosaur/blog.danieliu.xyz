Found a cool anime site for learning japanese: <a href="https://animelon.com/">animelon.com</a>. It provides english subtitles as well as japanese (with options for romaji, ひらがな and カタカナ). You can also hover over subtitles to get definitions, and jump between dialogue lines. It also has some more hardcore features like saving dialogue for flashcard quizzes. I'm not hardcore so I just like to have the two subs at the same time and do some passive learning. Overall the uploads are decently high quality so it can used for general anime-watching too. Only downside is that it's selection is much smaller than your standard site, and it almost completely lacks the newer seasonal stuff, since they need time to make the necessary subs or whatever. Anyways that's it, doesn't hurt to give it a shot.
