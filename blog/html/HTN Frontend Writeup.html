<p>
This is the writeup detailing some design choice that went into my Hack the North Frontend Challenge.
The task was to create a mock hackathon page with a schedule to display workshops and talks and such
that would be taking place.
</p>

<h2>Frameworks, Tools and Other Goodness</h2>

<p>
My first impulse was to use react with typescript to build the frontend. However, I was already quite short
on time since I spent some time on the backend challenge. So I decided to stick with vue, which I am more
comfortable with. I also brought in vuex and vue-router since they would be needed anyways when the project
scales.
</p>

<p>
In the past, when running boilerplate code, ESlint was always bundled, and I recall getting infuriated by
how picky it was, throwing a tantrum and preventing your code from running with you have a trailing space
or something. However, I probably got a bit fed up with having to deal with inconsistent code style when
working in a group, so I decided give it another shot. In the end, I gotta say it sorta grew on me.
</p>

<p>
I have always been putting off learning docker, but I have finally decided to give it a shot this time. I'll
be talking more about this in the deployment section later, where I deploy the project onto my own vps with
nginx.
</p>

<p>
Finally, for styling, I did some mixing and matching to my preferences. I used vuetify since they have a nice
calendar component. Unfortunately, material design is not my favorite and vuetify was a bit more strict on the
style, so I also opted for vue-bootstrap for a bit more fine tune control.
</p>

<h2>Auth</h2>

<p>
My idea for auth is to use json web tokens, although it depends on the backend I suppose. Anways, the idea is that
whenever the server authenticates the user, they give back a token that the user stores in the local storage
of the browser. This can help preserve login even if the tab is closed, and also serves a double purpose of a way
to check to see if the user is currently logged in and displaying corresponding components (like a logout button
instead of login). For the time being the auth module just returns a dummy promise, but it can be swapped out easily.
</p>

<p>
Also, I would like to present possibly the most innovative authorization code in history. It runs on the client side
for maximum performance of course.
</p>

<h2>Handling Data</h2>

<p>
Since the request the frontend makes to the server is just to get hackathon events, I thought about making a single
request to the server for all the data on launch, and having the app reference the local data instead. This should
work since hackathon events generally won't be changing much, especially across the time the user is on the app.
</p>

<h2>Localization</h2>
<p>
At one point I decided it would be cool to provide some translations for the page, since a virtual
hackathon tends to attract a larger audience. For this project, I decided to provide english and
japanese (no particular reason). A pretty interesting localization project called i18n has a vue integration
so I decided to give it a shot. The idea of i18n is to provide metadata for each locale like so
</p>
<pre><code>{
    'en': {
        hello-text: 'Hello World!'
    },
    'ja': {
        hello-text: 'このいちは，世界！'
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
and then later in your vue component you can do something like so:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{{ $t('hello-text') }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And based on a locale variable you set, the text will be automagically generated. My first impression of
this was it could get pretty unmaintainable with many components. However, i18n has support for single
file components. By getting a specialized Vue loader, you can use i18n tags alongside in your vue components,
like so
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{{ $t('hello-text') }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;i18n&gt;
{
    "en": {
        "hello-text": "Hello World!"
    },
    "ja": {
        "hello-text": "このいちは，世界！"
    }
}
&lt;/i18n&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Beautiful. i18n is great for managing localizations, but I get the impression that it may not scale as well when
you have more languages, as the files will get pretty crowded. Perhaps it may be better to use machine translations.
For the scale of this project, it works perfectly.
</p>

<h2>Deploy</h2>

<p>
It's my first time deploying with docker, so it was quite the interesting experience. I found it especially awesome when
I was messing around with docker how I could run my node app without having node installed. Getting nginx to play right
with docker and properly mapping the ports was a bit of a headache. In the end, I couldn't get the frontend to work inside
docker, so I just deployed it normally. Finally, I used certbot to get https up.
</p>

<h2>Extending</h2>

<p>
Hackathon application pages always impressed me quite a lot. I definitely wanted to make some sort of flashy animation
process, which would also be pretty great for me to practice my design (my css-fu needs some improvement).
Also, although the scope might be much bigger. I would have like to make a hacker dashboard, where you can view your responses
to the application and view your application status.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Anyways, this has been a fun project where I got to learn a decent amount, despite the fact that it felt like a back-to-back hackathon
(combined with the backend section). You can view the final product <a href="https://pinohacks.xyz">here</a>, as well as the git repo
